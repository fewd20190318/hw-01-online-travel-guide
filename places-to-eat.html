            <h3>PUFFIN</h3>
            <p>This unique and adorable bird is found only in certain parts of the world, Iceland being one of them. Puffins are harvested through “sky fishing”, where hunters use a tall net to catch them in the sky.
            </p>
            <p>
            Make sure to try the smoked puffin at <a href="https://www.3frakkar.is/">3Frakkar Restaurant</a> You will be impressed by the flavorful and tender meat.

          <li>
            <h3>HORSE</h3>
            <p> Trying local delicacies offers both a food and cultural experience. Horse has been compared to a tender beef filet mignon.
            These two Reykjavik restaurants serve the traditional dish: <a href="https://www.forrettabarinn.is/en/">Forrettabarinn</a> and <a href="https://www.3frakkar.is/">3Frakkar</a>.

          <li>
            <h3>COD TONGUES</h3>
            <p> Cod is probably the most important food of Iceland because it is in demand all over Europe, and you’ll see it done from two to ten different ways on every Icelandic menu. Cod tongues actually refer to the meat in the face of the cod: cheeks, chin, etc. These are the most tender parts of the fish and are deep-fried and served with a dipping sauce.
