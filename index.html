        <p>No trip to Ireland is complete without a visit to County Galway on the west coast of the country.</p>
        <p>Home to over 250,000 people and named the European Capital of Culture for 2020, this vibrant region offers something for everyone â€“ rugged countryside, beautiful beaches, thriving city culture, historical castles, amazing food and plenty of Guinness.</p>
        <p>Galway County was first inhabited over 7,000 years ago and originally comprised of several kingdoms and territories that predate the formation of the county.</p>
        <p>Visitors flock to Galway year-round, and is particularly busy around key events like the Galway International Arts Festival, the Galway Races and the Galway Oyster Festival.</p>
        <p>Plan your trip for the spring or summer when your chances at a dry day are slightly better than the rest of the year (rainy days are a common occurrence in the west of Ireland).</p>
