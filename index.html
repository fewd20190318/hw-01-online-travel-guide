          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>The land of the siesta, daily life in Spain moves slowly and runs  late.
          Everyone here is just enjoying life.
          Which is why traveling and backpacking Spain is so much fun.
          Spain is a beautiful, interesting, and dynamic country with a lot of regional uniqueness and variety. Madrid and Barcelona are hip and energetic cities, Granada has a Moorish touch, Basque Country up north contrast itself to Southern living.
          The Spaniards love visitors, hosting strangers, drinking good wine, laughing at a good meal, and enjoying life. People aren’t in a rush here.
          And, as an added bonus, Spain is super cheap. It’s a very inexpensive country to visit.
          I’ve been visiting Spain for over a decade and have been throughout the country.
          This budget and backpacking travel guide to Spain can help you figure out what to see, do, how to save money, stay safe, and everything in between!
