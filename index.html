    <h3>Welcome</h3>

    <p>The Yucatán Peninsula is a region of southeastern <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Mexico">Mexico</a>, consisting of the Mexican states of Yucatán, Campeche, and Quintana Roo. The Yucatán was the home of the Maya civilization before it was conquered by the Spanish Conquistadors in the 16th century. Much of the population is part or all of Maya descent, and in many places the Maya language is still spoken, usually in addition to Spanish, the main language of business.</p>

    <p>Until the mid 20th century, most of the Peninsula's trade with the rest of Mexico was by sea, and the culture, cuisine, and traditions developed different flavors from other parts of Mexico. Starting in the late 20th century the Yucatan has become more integrated into Mexico, especially such areas on the Caribbean coast as Cancun and Chetumal, where many people from other parts of the nation have moved to take advantage of the economic opportunities of development. The <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Mayan_Riviera">Mayan Riviera</a> stretching south from Cancun has seen the most growth related to tourism.</p>

    <h3>History & Culture</h3>

    <p>The Maya civilization flourished in the Yucatán Peninsula for more than a thousand years before the Yucatán was conquered by the Spanish in the 1500s. The Maya and Spanish heritage combined to create the new culture of Yucatán. Until the mid-20th century there were no railways or highways linking the Peninsula to the rest of Mexico so most commerce was by sea. The long-term comparative isolation of the Yucatán helped make it one of the most culturally distinctive regions in Mexico.</p>

    <p>Yucatán is famous for ancient Maya ruins such as Chichén Itzá. Contrary to the strange misconception, the Maya people never "disappeared". Most of Yucatan is still predominantly Maya. Maya culture, identity, traditions and language are very much alive, especially outside of main cities. Referring to locals as Mexican rather than Maya risks offending them.</p>

    <p>Away from beaches and tourist hotels, walking round in a bathing suit or short shorts is considered improper. At the very least, for a woman, scanty attire will invite stares and unwelcome comments. If you plan to enter churches, be sure to have something to cover your shoulders at the very least.</p>
