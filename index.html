    <h3>Top Five Reasons to Visit Portland</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Beer! Beautiful Beer</li>
        <p>Portland is home to some 70 breweries,more than a hundred in the larger metro area</p>
      <li>Food carts</li>
        <p>In a city renowned for its food, you can find some of Portland's most inventive chefs clustered in parking lots, preparing meal magic in food carts that range from old vacation trailers to sheds where you'd store your lawnmower.</p>
      <li>Saw in on Portlandia</li>
        <p>An outlandish yet humorously insightful look at all things Portland, this hit comedy series has both defined the city and annoyed some locals with its iconic line about Portland being 'where young people go to retire'. The Peabody Award-winning Portlandia skewers local pretensions (hardcore foodies, bike messengers) and is a great introduction for those planning to visit.</p>
      <li>Funky Hoods</li>
        <p>Downtown Portland is compact, historic, walkable and has a great riverfront park, but the real fun is out in the compass-spanning neighborhoods. Three winners: Southeast's Hawthorne Boulevard, once a hippie holdout but now a blend of indie boutiques, bars, restaurants, an iconic movie house, and pretty residential streets; North Mississippi Avenue, which has an edgier, grittier mix plus a fab food cart pod; and northeast's Alberta Street, a long-gentrified-but-still-fun strip of galleries, shops, great little cafes and bars, plus a monthly street party called Last Thursday that's pure Weird Portland.</p>
      <li>Legal Weed</li>
        <p>Perhaps due to the sheer timing of cannabis legalization passing at the same time Portland, Oregonâ€™s cultural reputation was drawing in peak numbers of ex-pat creatives seeking a hip, left-of-center and locally-sourced home, the recreational cannabis scene has rapidly developed into a sophisticated industry.</p>
