          <h2>Things To Do In Galway</h2>
          <p>Here are some recommendations for interesting things for you to do on your trip to Galway.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Visit Galway City</h3>
          <img src="images/do-galway-city.jpg" alt="Galway City">
          <p>
            A stroll through the bustling, colorful streets of Galway City is always entertaining, quite literally. Buskers, from musicians and dancers to tightrope walkers and magicians, come to Galway from all over the world to entertain the locals and tourists alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            Start at Eyre Square and wander down Shop Street for the quintessential experience, poking down the cobbled side streets and popping into shops, restaurants and pubs as you go.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take a quick break and refuel with a visit to our favorite coffee/craft shop Coffeewerk + Press or grab a snack at Murphy’s Ice Cream (you won’t be disappointed by the Dingle Sea Salt).

          <h3>Hike Diamond Hill</h3>
          <img src="images/do-diamond-hill.jpg" alt="View from Diamond Hill in Connemara">
          <p>
            No visit to Galway is complete without a visit to the lovely Connemara - a beautiful, remote area on Ireland’s western coastline facing the Atlantic Ocean.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many places throughout the district to get breathtaking views. If you’re coming from Galway City, you’ll pass many vista points on the drive through alone. But the best views by far come from the top of Diamond Hill in Connemara National Park.
          </p>
          <p>
            From here, you’ll get the optimal perspective of the dramatic landscape. You’ll see the rising peaks of the Twelve Bens Mountains, the historic Kylemore Abbey and lough, and Connemara’s intricate coastline in the distance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The looped hike up and down Diamond Hill takes about 2-3 hours, covering a distance of 7km and an ascent of 400m. The trail up the mountain is well-paved, although there are some steep inclines, so it’s not for the faint of heart.
          </p>

          <h3>Ferry To The Aran Islands</h3>
          <img src="images/do-aran-islands-inishmore.jpg" alt="Ancient Ruins on the Aran Island of Inishmore">
          <p>
            The Aran Islands are a group of three small islands at the mouth of Galway Bay, accessible by a short ferry ride from Rossaveal. As few cars are allowed on the islands, your best way to explore each will be on bike or by foot.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest of the three is Inishmore (literally the big island), featuring the incredible archeological site of Dun Aonghasa where you can take in the exquisite view of the ocean waves crashing along the cliffs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Explore the ancient ruins, small villages and shop handmade crafts while you’re there.
