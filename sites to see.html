    <h3>The Fresh Things to do at Inkopolis<h3>
        <br>
        <br>

    <p>
      Turf War	A mode consisting of four players in two teams. The aim is to cover a map with their team's ink color; the team with the highest ink coverage after three minutes wins the match.
    </p>

  <p>
    Splat Zones	Two teams fight to keep control of specially marked zones on the map by covering them with their ink. When all Zones are under a team's control, the team's timer counts down toward zero. The timer will stop if the opposing team takes control of the Zones, and their timer will begin count down. Both teams start at 100 on their counters. The team whose timer gets to zero wins the match. After 5 minutes, if neither team gets their timer to zero, the team who got their timer the lowest wins.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tower Control	Players compete for control of a central Tower platform, which will move through the stage towards enemy territory along a path when a player stands on it. If the Tower is overtaken by an opponent, it will reverse direction. Whichever team rides the tower to their respective goal spot at the end of the path wins.
  </P>

  <p>
    Rainmaker	Players compete for control of the Rainmaker, a unique weapon used only in this mode. The goal is to take it into the enemy base and place it on a pedestal, ending with a knockout if either team does so. The Rainmaker is very heavy, preventing the user from performing a Super Jump, but can fire ink tornadoes similar to those of the Inkzooka.
  </p>

  <p>
    Salmon Run	A co-op multiplayer mode where up to four players collect Power Eggs and Golden Eggs by defeating Salmonids, and then deposit the Golden Eggs in an egg basket. Online Salmon Run is only available during pre-determined times; it is always available offline at The Shoal.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clam Blitz	The objective of Clam Blitz is to pick up clams, which are scattered around the stage, and deposit them into the shielded goal near the opposing team's base. Players picking up clams may choose to build the Power Clam needed to break open the opponent's goal, or toss the clams to teammates so that they can build the Power Clam; completed Power Clams can also be tossed between teammates, as carrying them introduces a risk to the carrier by showing the location of the carrier to all opponents.</p>
