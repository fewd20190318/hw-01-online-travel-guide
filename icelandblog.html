     driving/renting a car-
definitely get gravel and windshield insurance, you will be driving on a few gravel roads

you are going in summer so you won’t need a car with 4 wheel drive

I got a wifi box for my car and honestly it never worked…

you will definitely need to get an international plan on your phone or if you have an old phone
that is in tact, bring it and buy a sim card at the airport to use while you are there for google maps and calls etc

they do have camera’s on some of the main roads so definitely watch your speed, they drive kinda slow on their main roads compared to our standards. There is usually a white sign with black writing before the cameras, they are to the right in a tan colored metal box with lights on top of each other.

there are round-a-bouts everywhere there so be careful when exiting them that you are in the correct lane, when i was driving there it always magically worked out

you will need to go through and see where you want to go ahead of time and have the names saved in your phone because they spell things with letters that don’t exist in english and the place will not show up on google maps if it’s not typed correctly
</p>
<p>
Golden Circle

I got to town early am and started driving the golden circle by myself

places I went:

Fontana geothermal bath (where I took a nap in the parking lot in my car)

Þingvellir park and Öxarárfoss Waterfall
you will have to pay for parking i think they take credit card
there is a church there and a little walk with a river and a waterfall. you can also go snorkeling in the lake with a tour

greenhouses at Friðheimar- this place is an awesome tomato greenhouse with amazing food, expensive, but worth it

Geysir

Gullfoss Waterfall which is the farthest and a 2 hour drive from Reykjavik
</p>

Reykjavik

you will definitely want to go to the top of the church which you will need some cash for



you need to go to the top dog stand Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur - i ate there for dinner 2 nights in a row

Grótta Island Lighthouse- it is on the outskirts of the town might be nice at sunset if you have time

blue lagoon
you will drive by it when you are coming from the airport- so depending on what time you leave on the last day you could make a stop there? you will want at least an hour there. with the basic package you also get to do a facemark and i think you get a tea. Don’t put your hair in the water! bring or rent an extra towel if you can. If i were you i would try to go later at night if you will be there at a time that the sun doesn't really set, there will be way less people there.
</p>
<p>
West Coast
bring cash with you- you will have to pay a toll on the way there and back when you drive under the bridge (a tunnel under the water)

i did a tour of the Snæfellsnes peninsula

kirkjufell mountain - if you walk down the path you can get a shot of just the mountain, look for the eye

black church

arnarstapi arch - which is the arch with the key hole in it
this is about 2.5 hours away
</p>

<p> south coast
what we did on my tour in 2 days

Flóahreppur waterfall

Seljalandsfoss waterfall

Skógafoss waterfall- bring a poncho and wait to see if you see the rainbow, but you will get absolutely soaked

black sands at Reynisfjara Beach- don't get close to water line, they have “sneak waves” a huge wave that will wash up and take you out to sea and the current is way to strong

Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon (was just meh in my opinion and might be melted when you go in summer)
it is right by diamond beach which is a few min down the road from this

this is 4.5 hours from reykjavik, doing all this might take you 2 days so I would look into staying near these areas if you can

then we did ice caving near Höfn which is where you might find a good area to do a glacier hike

we also stayed at the Hótel Höfn overnight
