            <h3>Northern Lights</h3>

          </div>

          <p>The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.
          </p>
          <p>The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman Goddess of Dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the North Wind, Boreas. From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.
          </p>

          <p>The Blue Lagoon is a geothermal spa in southwestern Iceland. The spa is located in a lava field near Grindavík on the Reykjanes Peninsula, in a location favourable for geothermal power, and is supplied by water used in the nearby Svartsengi geothermal power station.

          <p>Gullfoss is a waterfall located in the canyon of the Hvítá river in southwest Iceland.
          </p>

          <p>Did you know: During the first half of the 20th century and some years into the late 20th century, there was much speculation about using Gullfoss to generate electricity.</p>
