      <h2>Other Things to do in Spain</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Join the Running of the Bulls</li>
        <p>Held in July in Pamplona, the Running of the Bulls attracts both the brave and the stupid. While I’d never do the actual running, the multi-day celebration is still a good place to go drink sangria, eat good food, wear a red scarf, and celebrate the way only Spain can.
        </p>

        <li>Lounge on the Costa Del Sol</li>
        <p>Come hang out on the beach and enjoy the laid-back life for which Spain is famous. The sun coast in southern Spain is famous for its beautiful beaches, great nightlife (and tons of tourists). Malaga is one of the biggest places on the coast but I think there are better places further down.</p>

        <li>Go to Valencia</li>
        <p>Valencia is a pretty amazing town. Initially, I wasn’t attracted to Valencia for any reason in particular — I came for the tomato fight in the nearby town of Bunol, which attracts thousands of people each August, most of whom use Valencia as their home base. However, Valencia grew on me. It has great seafood, paella, history, and a good soccer team. I would go back in a second. It’s a wonderful city!</p>
