          <h3>Banchan</h3>
          <p> Banchan refers to those delicious little side dishes served at the start of a Korean meal. I like to think of them as Korean tapas. They’re typically offered as ancillary dishes, but Sigol Bapsang in Itaewon serves them as the main course. There you’ll get at least 20 different kinds of banchan for just KRW 8,000 per person with rice and sundubu jjigae.</p>

          <h3>Bibimap</h3>
          <p>Like Korean barbecue, bibimbap is one of the most popular Korean dishes outside of the country. It literally means “mixed rice” and refers to a bowl of warm white rice topped with gochujang (Korean chili paste) and a variety of sauteed and seasoned vegetables like cucumber, soy bean sprouts, radish, spinach, and mushroom. An egg (raw or fried) and sliced meat, typically beef, are often added. The contents are then mixed together thoroughly before being eaten.

          There are multiple variations of bibimbap, one of the most famous being Jeonju bibimbap. Grandma Yu’s Bibimbap is described as being one of the most authentic places in Seoul to try Jeonju bibimbap.</p>

          <h3>Bossam</h3>
          <p>Bossam refers to pork belly which is boiled in a broth with spices like star anise, ginger, scallion, garlic, and soybean paste, then thinly sliced. It’s served with a variety of side dishes and eaten as ssam – wrapped in vegetables like lettuce or perilla leaves. Bossam is a popular anju dish, meaning it’s a food typically consumed with alcohol like soju or beer.

          Pictured below is a platter of bossam and jokbal at Manjok Ohyang Jokbal. The bossam is the lighter-colored rectangles of meat on the right side of the plate. We didn’t go but a recommended place to try it is at Bossam Alley, a cluster of bossam specialty restaurants in Jongno-gu.</p>
