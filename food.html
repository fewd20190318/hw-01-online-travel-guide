      <h3>A Word of Caution</h3>

        <p>Tap water is not generally advised for drinking in Mexico, particularly for visitors. In many places (particularly backpacker-friendly resorts) water containers can be filled with drinking water for a few pesos - so a reusable container is both an environmentally and financially better option.</p>
        <p>The water system in Mérida is unusually good for Mexico; for some visitors it is the only Mexican city where they will drink the tap water. Outside of this city the situation is different. In small towns the local water can be very bad, and bottled water is recommended.</p>
        <p>It would be difficult for anyone visiting this area not to sample the Tequila, which should be used in moderation. For those more adventurous souls, Absinthe is legal in Mexico and also, moderation is suggested. Fresh fruit juice (called jugo or agua when juice is mixed with water) is very popular in the Yucatan. Freshly squeezed OJ can be found in most markets. Other fresh juices can include limón or lima (lemonade or limeade), naranjada (orange juice with water), mango, piña (pineapple), melón (canteloupe), sandía (watermelon) and more.</p>
