            <p>You will travel at high speeds on the airboat tour, but also slow down and stop for pictures. Along the way, you will get a personal tour by your local Captain. Our airboats have stadium style seating, so that the person in front of you does not obstruct your view.  Every airboat seat is great for experiencing the tour and viewing the wildlife.
            Gators will get close……. real close!!!  So close that you will be able to look into those reptilian eyes.</p>
